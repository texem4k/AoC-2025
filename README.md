# Advent of Code

### Welcome to my AoC 2025. 

###
#### Why doing this?
First of all, this was idea from my **Software Engineering Teacher**,  
and I had to say that I've been having fun doing this, this was a very good idea.

If you are here, and you don't know what is **Advent of Code**, is basically  
one programming problem (with part I and II) every day until advent day ,  
(tipically 24 but this year is to 12).
###

#### Whats the main goal?
Well, the main target of this project is develop good habits and mental about  
clear code. Using the patterns and the principles that we learned.  
In one way, we can apply and learn concepts that are useful in real life 


###


#### How it's everything organized?
You have everything organized in folders:

* **Doc** -> The documentation is in the *Doc* folder, with the problem info in spanish because I'm not going to translate everything :/    
* **src/main** -> The Production Code, the tasty things :)
* **src/test** -> The Testing Environment, there are one class per problem, with their respective tests. 
  * **src/test/resources** -> This folder have all the inputs of the AoC for each daily problem.

By the way, all the written code is documented, to facilitate understanding :)
